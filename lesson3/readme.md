### Topics covered

Getting datasets from kaggle on a dataset of sattelite images

A partial function is a new function made from an existing function with a parameter of the existing function set

In this sattelite example since it has multiple labels we don't use accuracy to measure the effectiveness since it uses argmax which selects maximum from a list of possibliities however in this case what we want is to select all the classes that are above a certain threshold acc_thresh

Use of datablock
