# Working with imagenette

## Objectives

We will look at what normalization is, a powerful data augmentation technique called mixup, the progressive resizing approach and test time augmentation. To show all of this, we are going to train a model from scratch (not using transfer learning) using a subset of ImageNet called Imagenette.
