The mean of all seven tensors:

why to use tensors than normal array because they are fast

Numpy and pytorch tensor vaies that that pytorch tenorshoud have same basic type for all basic arrays.

Pytorch structures aremade for GPU, and can automatically find derivatives.

metric is for calculating how good a model is

broadcasting does mean using extra memory
