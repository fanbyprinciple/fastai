    %%javascript
    function ClickConnect(){
    console.log("Working");
    document.querySelector("colab-toolbar-button#connect").click()
    }setInterval(ClickConnect,60000)

    This needs to be added before a training loop

    ## Command Line
    # note, your file_id can be found in the shareable link of the file
    ! pip install gdown -q
    ! gdown â€” id <file_id>
    ## In Python
    import gdown
    url = https://drive.google.com/uc?id=<file_id>
    output = 'my_archive.tar'
    gdown.download(url, output, quiet=False)

    gdown to grab publically available lib

    import os
    from getpass import getpass
    import urllib
    user = 'rbracco'
    password = getpass('Password: ')
    repo_name = 'fastai2_audio'
    # your password is converted into url format
    password = urllib.parse.quote(password)
    cmd_string = 'git clone https://{0}:{1}@github.com/{0}/{2}.git'.format(user, password, repo_name)
    os.system(cmd_string)
    cmd_string, password = "", "" # removing the password from the variable
    # Bad password fails silently so make sure the repo was copied
    assert os.path.exists(f"/content/{repo_name}"), "Incorrect Password or Repo Not Found, please try again"
    best wayto connect to github

    !git config --global user.email <YOUR EMAIL>
    !git config --global user.name <YOUR NAME>

    add these two at start to let git know who you are

    
Here is definitive proof that "gpu is what you need for deep learning".
Post setup checkup locally.

However it is recommended that we take a cloud provider for running the state of the art models, my gtx 1050 can handle only so much.
