# fastai

my fast.ai v3 and v4 repo :smile_cat:

fastai makes me happy

Note: The video lectures given in youtube and the site are very different. The best place is the site as the latest books are present.

for v4 I will follow www.github.com/fastai/fastbook.

4. colab hints
<https://medium.com/@robertbracco1/configuring-google-colab-like-a-pro-d61c253f7573>

``` python
    %%javascript
    function ClickConnect(){
    console.log("Working");
    document.querySelector("colab-toolbar-button#connect").click()
    }setInterval(ClickConnect,60000)

    This needs to be added before a training loop

    ## Command Line
    # note, your file_id can be found in the shareable link of the file
    ! pip install gdown -q
    ! gdown — id <file_id>
    ## In Python
    import gdown
    url = https://drive.google.com/uc?id=<file_id>
    output = 'my_archive.tar'
    gdown.download(url, output, quiet=False)

    gdown to grab publically available lib

    import os
    from getpass import getpass
    import urllib
    user = 'rbracco'
    password = getpass('Password: ')
    repo_name = 'fastai2_audio'
    # your password is converted into url format
    password = urllib.parse.quote(password)
    cmd_string = 'git clone https://{0}:{1}@github.com/{0}/{2}.git'.format(user, password, repo_name)
    os.system(cmd_string)
    cmd_string, password = "", "" # removing the password from the variable
    # Bad password fails silently so make sure the repo was copied
    assert os.path.exists(f"/content/{repo_name}"), "Incorrect Password or Repo Not Found, please try again"
    best wayto connect to github

    !git config --global user.email <YOUR EMAIL>
    !git config --global user.name <YOUR NAME>

```

add these two at start to let git know who you are

Here is definitive proof that "gpu is what you need for deep learning".
Post setup checkup locally.

However it is recommended that we take a cloud provider for running the state of the art models, my gtx 1050 can handle only so much.

## Documentation

inorder to know what a particular function does simply append ?? in front of the function
for ex-

`learn.predict??`

for full documentation

`doc(accuracy)`

### Setting up FASTAI in colab

![colabgpu](colab_gpu.png)

How to open google collab for fast ai

1. open from github
    The github url fo collab
    fastai/course-v3

2. change runtime type to gpu

3. install necessary packages
    `!curl -s https://course.fast.ai/setup/colab | bash`

   for fastai v2:

   ```python
   !pip install -Uqq fastbook
    import fastbook
    fastbook.setup_book()
    ```

4. save a copy in drive
youll be automatically promted to run this

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

### using render to deploy the models
